User Story
You are working as a freelance developer, Sylvester Presly is the founder of “Smash It” and they hope to create an outdoor event in NYC in the coming months. Sylvester Presly contacted you and he wants you to build a weather app where users can get weather information in real-time.

> PS: This weather information will be a determinant if the event will hold or not, it is safe to say that it is winter in NYC now.

Sylvester Presly has a budget of \$3,000 and he wants a few features on the website.

Guidelines for API

We are to use the open weather API to make our API request, read the documentation to enable you understand how it works.

Project to-dos:
Design:

1. You are expected to come up with your own User interface, If you're looking for inspiration, check out other weather websites, you can also get inspirations from uplabs, site inspire, Behance
2. The aesthetic of the website is up to you as far as users can get weather information back after a search.

Technical requirements:

The website must meet PWA criteria i.e

   You can audit your website using google lighthouse in your chrome developer tools, in the Audit tab.
